# A WASM Plugin in JavaScript (jco / ComponentizeJS)

A fidius WASM plugin is an ordinary WebAssembly **component** that satisfies an
interface's WIT contract — the language is irrelevant to the host. This guide
implements the **same `greeter` interface** as
[Your First WASM Plugin (Rust)](../tutorials/your-first-wasm-plugin.md) and
[the Python guide](wasm-python-plugin.md), this time in **JavaScript**, and loads
it through the identical host path. Three languages, one host, one descriptor —
that is the polyglot payoff of the Component Model (ADR FIDIUS-A-0003, "Path B").

The worked example is the committed fixture `tests/wasm-fixtures/greeter-js/`,
verified by `polyglot_js_guest_behaves_identically` in `crates/fidius-host`.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js + `jco` (ComponentizeJS): invoked via `npx -y @bytecodealliance/jco`.
- `wasm-tools` to validate — see
  [Set Up the WASM Component Toolchain](wasm-component-toolchain.md).

There is **no fidius dependency** in the guest — it only has to satisfy the WIT
([the same contract](wasm-python-plugin.md#1-the-wit-contract) the Rust and
Python guests implement).

## 1. Implement it in JavaScript

`jco` maps the exported interface to an ESM **named export** matching the
interface (`greeter`). Kebab-case WIT names become lowerCamelCase
(`echo-bytes` → `echoBytes`). Type mapping: `s64`/`u64` → **`BigInt`**,
`list<u8>` → **`Uint8Array`**, `result<T, _>` → return `T` (throw for the error
arm):

```js
// greeter.js
export const greeter = {
  greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
  },
  add(a, b) {
    return a + b; // BigInt + BigInt — the Ok arm of result<s64, plugin-error>
  },
  echoBytes(data) {
    return new Uint8Array(Array.from(data).reverse());
  },
  fidiusInterfaceHash() {
    return 0x0102030405060708n; // MUST equal the interface hash (BigInt / u64)
  },
};
```

!!! warning "The interface hash must match"
    `fidius-interface-hash` is an integrity check — the host compares it to the
    descriptor's `interface_hash` and refuses a mismatch at load. The interface
    author publishes the expected value (the Rust macros compute it from the
    signatures). It is **not** a security boundary — signing is.

## 2. Build the component

```bash
npx -y @bytecodealliance/jco componentize greeter.js \
  --wit path/to/wit --world-name greeter-plugin \
  --disable http fetch-event \
  --out greeter_js.wasm

wasm-tools validate --features component-model greeter_js.wasm
```

!!! note "Disable features the sandbox won't grant"
    ComponentizeJS embeds a JS engine (StarlingMonkey) that, by default, imports
    `wasi:http` for `fetch`. fidius's WASM sandbox is **deny-all** and does not
    wire `wasi:http` into the linker, so an HTTP-enabled component fails to
    instantiate with *"component imports instance `wasi:http/types`, but a
    matching implementation was not found"*. `--disable http fetch-event` drops
    those imports; `clocks`/`random`/`stdio` are fine (the host provides them).
    The result is a component exporting `fidius:greeter/greeter` — the same
    artifact shape as the Rust and Python guests (larger, since it embeds the JS
    engine: ~12 MB).

## 3. Package, sign, and load

Identical to any fidius package — the `[wasm]` section names the component and its
capability allow-list:

```toml
# greeter-js-pkg/package.toml
[package]
name = "greeter-js-pkg"
version = "0.1.0"
interface = "greeter"
interface_version = 1
runtime = "wasm"

[metadata]
category = "demo"

[wasm]
component = "greeter_js.wasm"
capabilities = []
```

```rust
// The host loads it through the SAME API as the Rust and Python guests.
let handle = host.load_wasm("greeter-js-pkg", &Greeter_WASM_DESCRIPTOR)?;
let greeting: String = handle.call_method(0, &("Ada".to_string(),))?;
assert_eq!(greeting, "Hello, Ada!");
```

The host neither knows nor cares that the component is JavaScript — it loads,
sandboxes, and dispatches it exactly like the Rust and Python guests. That is the
polyglot guarantee.
